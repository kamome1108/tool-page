                    "a": "Format (beautify) adds indentation, line breaks, and spacing to make JSON human-readable. Minify removes all whitespace and formatting to reduce file size, which is useful for production environments."

                {
                    "q": "What is the maximum JSON file size?",
                    "a": "There's no hard limit on file size. However, very large JSON files (>10MB) may slow down your browser. For best performance, we recommend using files under 5MB."
